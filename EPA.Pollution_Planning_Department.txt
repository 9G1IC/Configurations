===============
1 THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION
  To issue environmental permits and pollution abatement notices for controlling
  the volume, types, constituents and effects of waste discharge, emissions,
  deposits or other source of pollutants and of substances which are hazardous or
  potentially dangerous to the quality of the environment or any segment of the environment.
  
  To co-ordinate the activities of such bodies as it considers appropriate for
  the purposes of controlling the generation, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal
  of industrial waste.

   To prescribe standards and guidelines relating to the pollution of air,
  water, land other forms of environmental pollution including the discharge of wastes and the
  control of toxic substances Chemicals Control Management Center - Management and disposal of hazardous
  chemical and waste

  The Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI)
  through the Environmental Protection Agency is implementing the Ghana Environmental
  Management Project (GEMP) in support of the implementation of Ghanaâ€™s National
  Action Program to Combat Drought and Desertification (NAP).

  To promote studies, research, surveys and analyses for the improvement and
  Protection of the environment and the maintenance of sound ecological systems in Ghana.

		DEPENDENCIES	
			External labs - Sample analysis
3 THEIR MAIN OPERATIONAL HINDRANCES AND ITS ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS
		Inadequate human resource * (More people are need for monitoring)
		Inadequate logistics * (Little equipment)
		Lack of enforceable standards
4 PROBLEM STATEMENT
		Dust pollution jeopardize human health - untarred roads
		Air pollution is increasing yearly
		Water pollutants render rivers dead
		Particles of size 10 micrometer exceeds safe limits in some regions
		Risk of financial loss through illnesses
		Stale data (old maps)
		Development goes ahead of planning
		Risk of accidents due to encroachments
		Faulty equipment
  
		CRITICAL FUNCTION
		This summaries the critical subject that can pertains to this ministry
Subject						Detection

Carbon Monoxide				Spectrometers
Lead						Spectrometers
Nitrogen Dioxide			Spectrometers	
Ozone						Spectrometers	
Particle Pollution			Spectrometers	
Sulfur Dioxide				Spectrometers	
Vegetation					Optical Images	
Noise						NOT FEASIBLE	

		NOTES
	Array-based spectrometers are relatively complex 	to integrate into a cubesat because of their power and link budgets.
